New kmedoids Python implementation that uses Fortran libraries and
f2py for faster execution. Written by Miguel A. Caro and Patricia
Hernández-León. Based on Cristian Bauckhage's implementation.

Currently under heavy development - better not to use unless you know
what you're doing.

We will update license, etc., when this is in more decent shape.
